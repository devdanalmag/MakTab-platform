# Concept Overview & Stakeholder Brief

## Project Title

**MaTab Tahfeez & Islamiyya App**
*A Smart Platform for Islamic and Qur’anic Education Management*

---

## 1. Introduction

Across Northern Nigeria, thousands of Islamiyya and Qur’anic schools serve as the backbone of Islamic education. Despite their importance, many of these institutions still rely heavily on manual processes for record-keeping, assessments, attendance tracking, and lesson planning. This results in excessive paperwork, data loss, inefficiencies, and limited visibility into students’ academic and spiritual progress.

The **MaTab Tahfeez & Islamiyya App** is designed to modernize this system by providing an easy-to-use digital platform that enables teachers and students to manage classes, record results, monitor Qur’an memorization, assess Islamic subjects, and strengthen Tajwīd practice - all in one unified solution.

## 9. Inspiration

This initiative emerged from firsthand observation of challenges faced by Islamiyya and Tahfeez teachers in Northern Nigeria - excessive paperwork, lost records, and minimal use of technology. The goal is to preserve traditional Islamic teaching methods while enhancing them with the structure, accuracy, and efficiency of modern digital tools.

## 10. Existing Alternatives & Market Gap

While solutions such as **Tarteel AI**, **Madrasa Apps**, and **Google Classroom** exist, none address the full ecosystem of Islamiyya education - combining Qur’anic memorization, Islamic subjects, Murāja’a planning, and Tajwīd correction in one mobile-friendly system.

**MaTab Tahfeez & Islamiyya App** uniquely fills this gap, meeting both the educational and cultural needs of Islamic institutions
